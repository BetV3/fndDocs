# Devices

The devices section of the FND GUI has a focus on multiple different actions you can perform on a group of devices or on a single device. The information within this section comes from the [Managing Devices](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/connectedgrid/iot_fnd/guide/5_0/b-iot-fnd-user-guide-50/m-device-management-sample.html) section of the 5.0 documentation
